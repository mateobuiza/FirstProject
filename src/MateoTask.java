/**
 * Create two fields. One called name, which is a String, and one which is called age which is an integer.
 *
 * Create a constructor, without parameters. Set name to equal mateo, and age to equal 22.
 *
 * Create another constructor, which accepts 2 parameters, name and int. Using the parameters, initialise the fields you
 * created.
 *
 * Create a method that accepts 3 integers in its parameters, works out the average of the three numbers and returns
 * the answer.
 *
 * Create another method, which accepts 3 integers in its parameters and finds out which one is the smallest number.
 * (possibly use if statements). Instead of returning the answer, print it out.
 *
 * Create a getter and setter for the 2 fields you created.
